With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.

**The timeline:**

- XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors
- XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007
- XI 3.1 - upgrade release in September 2008
- XI 3.1 SP2 - service pack release on 24 July 2009 - with enhanced SAP integration

**Where were we with XI R2:**

- Change to Crystal service-oriented platform (Crystal 10 architecture)
- Ability to plug Crystal Reports, Web Intelligence, Desktop Intelligence, OLAP Intelligence, Dashboard Manager, Performance Manager directly into the framework
- Single repository, security, system management, publishing, portal
- Infoview (Replaced old BO Infoview and Crystal ePortfolio)
- Central Management Console (CMC)
- Import Wizard (upgrades from BO 5, 6, XI, Crystal 8.5, 9, 10)
- Desktop Intelligence (new name for BO full client + ability to query and display Unicode data)
- Publishing, Encyclopedia, Discussions, OLAP Intelligence, Performance Management
- Changes to Data Integrator, Composer, Metadata Manager

- Native Web Intelligence printing (without PDF)
