In what seems to be a [speedy decision](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/28/SAP-retires-overlapping-BI-products_1.html) to clean up an overlapping product line, following its acquisition of Business Objects ([BOBJ](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ABOBJ)), [SAP](http://sap.com) has decided to retire the [Business Objects Performance Management](http://www.businessobjects.com/product/epm/) product.

Taking its place would be [SAP Strategy Management](http://www.sap.com/demos/demplayv2/demoPlayMaster.html?demos/Strategy_Management_US/Strategy_Management_US_config.xml) (a product [biguru](http://biguru.wordpress.com/about/) is SAP certified). **SAP Strategy Management** is the new name for what used to be Pilot Software's flagship product [PilotWorks](http://www.sap.com/usa/company/press/pilotsoftware/index.epx) product, which SAP acquired in February 2007. No doubt about the fact that PilotWorks Server which is based on a powerful OLAP engine, and has an extremely user-friendly GUI on top of it, is a few notches above the clunky Performance Manager of [BOBJ](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ABOBJ).

Another interesting part of the announcement was that SAP would keep alive the [Outlooksoft](http://www.outlooksoft.com) product (rebranded as **SAP Business Planning & Consolidation**) while planning to retire Business Objects' **SRC Software** (which BOBJ acquired in 2005) . At the same time, it would like to find out the consumers' preference by offering both **[Cartesis](http://www.businessobjects.com/company/acquisitions/welcome.asp)** and the Outlooksoft financial consolidation softwares.

It is a matter of conjecture, how far SAP will go in its decision to retire overlapping BI products. The Business Objects offerings have grown unwieldy over time and with increasing [overlap](http://www.businessobjects.com/product/catalog/crystalreports_server/) between [Crystal Reports](http://www.businessobjects.com/product/catalog/crystalreports/) and Business Objects [Web Intelligence](http://www.businessobjects.com/product/catalog/web_intelligence/) - the main two product lines have become a confusing choice. Add to this the direction shown by XI 3.0 with its Web Intelligence rich client, and [Xcelsius 2008](http://www.businessobjects.com/product/catalog/xcelsius/default.asp) going the Adobe Flex/Flash way. Business Objects however maintains that Web Intelligence remains for ad-hoc casual reporting over the web while Crystal Reports is for highly formatted reporting required for printing etc.

The [SAP BI roadmap](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/10c3bca6-7dbc-2a10-7aa8-81d2731c7bb1) is available here.

And here [SAP_s_BI_Chief_Juggles_Independence_Integration](http://www.cio.com/article/327564/SAP_s_BI_Chief_Juggles_Independence_Integration/) is the SAP BI head (former BOBJ CEO) John Schwarz talking about the challenges of integration and independence.
