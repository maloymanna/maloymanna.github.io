Sometime back I presented a webinar on BrightTalk. The slides for the talk have now been uploaded on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/itsmaloy/bi-in-the-digital-era). The talk focused more on changes in digital technology disrupting businesses, the effect of Big Data, the FOMO (Fear of missing out) effect on big business - and what it meant for changes to the way we do business intelligence in the digital era.
